# Dream Keeper

Dream Keeper is an Android application designed for personalized dream journalling. It allows users to record dreams with customizable features, including dates, descriptions, and tags. The app also offers a home screen widget for quick access.

## Features
- **Dream Entry**: Create dreams with specific dates, detailed descriptions, and a list of associated tags.
- **Advanced Search**: Filter dreams by date ranges, keywords in descriptions, and multiple tags simultaneously.
- **Custom Sorting**: Sort dreams by dream date, providing a more intuitive organization compared to other note-taking apps.
- **Home Screen Widget**: Access and create new dream entries directly from your home screen for convenience.

## Motivation

The inspiration for Dream Keeper stemmed from the limitations encountered with existing note-taking applications. Notably, the inability to search by multiple tags simultaneously and the lack of customizable sorting options in apps like Google Keep Notes. To overcome these challenges, Dream Keeper was developed to provide a tailored solution for dream journalling enthusiasts.
